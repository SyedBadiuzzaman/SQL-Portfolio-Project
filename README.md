I performed data exploration on global COVID-19 datasets containing cases, deaths, testing, and vaccination details.

Used SQL to identify countries with the highest vaccination rates using people_fully_vaccinated_per_hundred.

Analyzed how fast countries vaccinated their populations using new_vaccinations_smoothed_per_million.

Explored the relationship between hospital beds per thousand and death rates across countries.

Investigated if testing intensity impacted positivity rates using positive_rate and total_tests_per_thousand.

Studied the effect of lockdowns by comparing stringency_index with new case trends.

Merged two different tables using JOIN on location and date to get a more complete dataset.

Created a SQL view covid_full_data for combined analysis of cases, vaccinations, tests, and healthcare.

Explored how GDP per capita and healthcare capacity affected vaccination rollout and COVID outcomes.

Designed queries for deeper insights that could be visualized in dashboards or used in a portfolio project.
